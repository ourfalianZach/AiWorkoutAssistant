AiWorkoutAssistant is a full-featured AI-powered fitness app that lets users create, manage, and track personalized workout plans — all through a clean, interactive interface.
Users can generate workout plans in two ways:

AI-Generated Plans (GPT-4)
	•Input fitness goal, available minutes per day, and days per week.
	•The app uses OpenAI’s GPT API to generate a structured multi-day workout plan.
	•The user can edit the plan before saving, including adding/removing exercises and modifying sets, reps, and weights.

Manual Plans
	•Choose the number of workout days per week.
	•For each day, enter the focus area (e.g., “Chest and Triceps”) and add custom exercises with sets, reps, rest time, and weight.
	•Dynamic UI lets users add more exercises per day as needed.

View Saved Workout Plans
	•See all previously saved plans in a dropdown selector.
	•Each plan includes goals, structures, and exercises grouped by day.
	•Cleanly formatted for easy viewing and reference.


Edit Existing Plans
	•Re-open a saved plan and modify its structure:
	•Add or remove exercises.
	•Change any sets, reps, rest, or weights.
	•Save your changes directly without creating a new plan.

Delete Workout Plans
	•Remove any saved workout plan from your account with confirmation.
	•Deleted plans are permanently removed from the database.

Track Workout Progress
	•Log progress for specific exercises within any plan.
	•For each entry, you can record:
	•Day name
	•Sets and reps completed
	•Weight used
	•Optional notes
	•Date of completion
	•Progress is tied to specific plans to match goals and training splits.

Visualize Your Progress
	•Filter and view logged workouts by exercise name.
	•View all past entries in a clean table format.
	•See your weight progression over time in a line chart.

Modify or Delete Progress Entries
	•Update any logged entry’s sets, reps, weight, notes, or date.
	•Remove entries you no longer want with a single click.

•Works with a PostgreSQL database.
•Environment variables are managed with .env.
•Built with Streamlit, Python, and OpenAI GPT API.
